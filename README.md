# uoyths
A University of York Thesis class for LaTeX

Update to the original University of York LaTeX thesis template 
([https://github.com/ltn100/uoyths](https://github.com/ltn100/uoyths)) to comply
with the latest set of University regulations governing thesis layout (as of May 2016). While it has been designed
specifically for a thesis in the Department of Electronics, I see no reason why it cannot be used by those
in other departments, since such rules are University wide.

The changes made to meet the regulations include:
  - Page number at the bottom of every page
  - Header text and line in grey
  - University name corrected to University of York
  - *Department of* removed from department name
  - Reordering of front matter
  - Reordering of back matter
  - Added Contents, List of Tables, and List of Figures to Contents

In addition to the required changes, several stylistic changes have been implemented, such as:
  - Improved fonts
  - Hyper-ref by default
  - Removed chapter specific bibliographies
  - Simpler compilation
  - Streamlined glossary and nonmenclature
